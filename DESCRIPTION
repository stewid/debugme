Description: Sometimes the code we write does not do what we expect or
    raises an error. When this happens, we need to understand why. One
    approach is to inspect the code, but generally, it is more
    efficient to use a debugger and step through the code line by line
    to identify the mistake. The 'debugme' package contains some
    simple functions that can be used when teaching debugging in R and
    C code.
